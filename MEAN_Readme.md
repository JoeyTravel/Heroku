# MEAN Stack
`Mean is generally used to create browser-based `web applications because AngularJS 2 (client-side) and Express (server-side) are both framworks for web apps.  Another compelling use case for MEAN is the development of the RESTful API servers.  

### 1. MongoDB
  * Stores data in a JSON-like format
  
### 2. Express
  * Express and Node.js facilitate JSON query creation

### 3. Angular JS 2
 * Angular JS 2 allows the client to seamlessly send and receive JSON documents.
 
### 4. Node.js
 

## Development Protocol

 * `package.json` - A configuration file that contains the metadata for the application. When there is a `package.json` file in the root directory of the project, Heroku will use the Node.js buildpack to deploy the application.
 
 * `app.json` - A manifest format for describing web apps.  It declares environment variables, add-ons, and other information required to run an app on Heroku.  It is required to create `Deploy to Heroku` button.
